The Automation Analyzer is a Qlik Sense application built for Qlik Cloud, which
helps you to analyze and monitor Qlik Application Automation runs in your tenant.

![Sheets in the app](/images/readme_sheets.png)

Some of the benefits of this application are as follows:

- Track number of automations by type and by user
- Analyze concurrent automations
- Compare current month vs prior month runs
- Analyze failed runs - view all schedules and their statuses
- Tie in Qlik Alerting

This application:

- Pulls a max of 90 days of automation run history, and will then continue to build from there incrementally using QVDs.
- Does not pull in runs that are currently running.
- Should not be used as an audit application.

Endpoints:

- audits
- tenants
- spaces
- users
- automations
- automations/{id}/runs/{id}
